Differences in Procedure (P) and Function (F):

1) In case of P it may or may not return value.
    F has to return value. It will return value without Out and In Out parameters.

2) P can be independently called. F cannot get called independently.

3) F can get called in various ways:
a) Inside PLSQL block.
b) In Select statement's column list, where, group by, having, order by clauses.
c) In Update and Delete Statements.
d) F can assign value to a variable
P can only be called in PLSQL block. B,C and D are N/A for P.

4) Inside P we should have DML along with code and validations
    Inside F we should have complex numeric, date, string calculations.

Examples of Function:

create or replace function  increment_salary (p_sal number)
return number
as
begin
	return (p_sal + p_sal *0.50);
end;

Test the logic of function using dual table.

select increment_salary(8000) from dual;

Once the answer is correct using dual table then call the function in select statement of your business or project table.

select ename, sal, increment_salary(sal) as "Incremented Salary"
from emp;

Now call the same function in Insert statement. For that creating table first.

create table new_emp
(empno number,
 ename varchar(10),
 sal number,
 incremented_sal number);

Insert into new_emp Values(1234, 'John', 10000, increment_salary(10000));

select * from new_Emp;

Example of function having DML statements. Its scope of usage gets restricted....

create or replace function trial (p number)
return number
as
begin
	Delete From Emp;
	return 0;
End;

Function gets created, but now this function cannot be called in Select or DML statements.

select trial(3) from dual; -- Error...
